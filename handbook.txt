## 1. Getting Started

### Initial Setup

**Step 1: Basic Configuration**
1. Use `/setup add_region` to add US states to your server
   - Add key battleground states first: Pennsylvania, Florida, Michigan, Wisconsin
   - Include safe red states: Texas, Alabama, Wyoming
   - Include safe blue states: California, New York, Massachusetts
   - Add swing states: Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina

2. Use `/setup set_start` to set your election start date
   - Format: YYYY-MM-DD
   - Example: `/setup set_start 2024-01-01`
   - This determines when your election cycle begins

3. Use `/setup set_announcement_channel` for election updates
   - Choose a channel where all major election events will be announced
   - This includes phase changes, major victories, and results

4. Use `/party admin create` to create custom parties if needed
   - Default parties: Democratic Party (Blue), Republican Party (Red), Independent (Purple)
   - Custom parties allow for roleplay scenarios or alternative political systems
   - Example: `/party admin create name:"Green Party" abbreviation:"G" color:"00FF00"`

5. Use `/election admin set_seats` to configure election seats
   - Sets up all available offices: Senate, House, Governor, President, VP
   - Determines which seats are up for election in each cycle

**Step 2: Understanding Election Phases**

The bot cycles through these phases automatically:

- **Signup Phase** (Duration: Varies)
  - Candidates register for elections using `/signup`
  - Presidential candidates use `/pres_signup`
  - VP candidates use `/vp_signup`
  - This is the planning phase where coalitions form

- **Primary Campaign** (Duration: Usually 2-4 weeks RP time)
  - Candidates campaign within their parties
  - Use demographic appeals and state-specific strategies
  - Build momentum and name recognition
  - Form alliances and endorsements

- **Primary Voting** (Duration: 1-3 days RP time)
  - Automated or admin-controlled voting
  - Winners become party nominees
  - Delegates are allocated in presidential races

- **General Campaign** (Duration: Usually 4-8 weeks RP time)
  - Party nominees face off
  - Momentum system becomes crucial
  - Demographic targeting reaches peak importance
  - Final coalition building

- **General Voting** (Duration: 1-3 days RP time)
  - Final election
  - All previous campaign work pays off
  - Winners determined by accumulated points and momentum

- **Governance** (Duration: Until next election cycle)
  - Winners serve their terms
  - Set up for next election cycle

**Step 3: Time Management**

Understanding the time system is crucial:

- Use `/time current_time` to check the current election phase
- Real time vs RP time: Admins can set how fast time moves
- Example: `/time set_time_scale 60` means 1 real hour = 1 RP day
- Elections automatically progress through phases based on configured timing

**Step 4: Basic Commands Every User Should Know**

Essential commands for all participants:
- `/commands` - View all available commands
- `/time current_time` - Check current phase and date
- `/signup` - Register as a candidate (during signup phase)
- `/speech` - Give a basic campaign speech
- `/momentum status` - Check state momentum
- `/demographic_status` - View your demographic progress (presidential candidates)

## 2. Basic Election Management

### Setting Up Elections

**Comprehensive Seat Configuration**

The election system supports multiple office types:

1. **Senate Seats** (6-year terms)
   - 3 senators per state in the default configuration
   - Staggered elections (different classes expire different years)
   - High-profile races that affect national politics

2. **House Seats** (2-year terms)
   - Multiple districts per state based on population
   - All seats up for election every cycle
   - More local, district-focused campaigns

3. **Governor Seats** (4-year terms)
   - One per state
   - Significant state-level executive power
   - Important for party momentum

4. **National Offices** (4-year terms)
   - President and Vice President
   - Highest-profile races
   - Electoral College system simulation

**Election Timing Configuration**

Proper timing is essential for realistic elections:

```
Example Timeline:
- January-March: Signup Phase
- April-June: Primary Campaign
- July: Primary Elections
- August-October: General Campaign
- November: General Election
- December-January: Transition/Governance
```

Use `/time set_time_scale` to control pacing:
- Fast pace: 30 (30 real minutes = 1 RP day)
- Medium pace: 60 (1 real hour = 1 RP day)
- Slow pace: 120 (2 real hours = 1 RP day)

### Candidate Registration Process

**General Election Signup**

During signup phases, candidates use:
- `/signup` for general elections (Senate, House, Governor)
- Must specify: name, party, seat, region/state
- Each user can run for multiple offices if allowed
- Withdrawals possible with `/withdraw_signup`

**Presidential Campaign Registration**

Presidential campaigns are more complex:

1. **Presidential Candidate Registration**
   ```
   /pres_signup name:"John Smith" party:"Democratic Party" 
   ideology:"Liberal" economic:"Progressive" social:"Liberal" 
   government:"Big Government" axis:"Left"
   ```

2. **Vice Presidential Registration**
   ```
   /vp_signup name:"Jane Doe" party:"Democratic Party"
   ideology:"Moderate" economic:"Centrist" social:"Liberal"
   government:"Moderate" axis:"Center-Left"
   presidential_candidate:"John Smith"
   ```

3. **Ticket Formation**
   - Presidential candidate must accept VP with `/accept_vp`
   - Creates official ticket for general election
   - Both candidates share resources and momentum

### Managing the Election Process

**Phase Transitions**

Elections progress automatically, but admins can intervene:

- `/time set_current_time` - Jump to specific date/phase
- Monitor transitions through announcement channel
- Handle disputes or special circumstances
- Adjust timing if needed for server activity

**Vote Management**

Admins have several options for handling votes:

1. **Automated Voting** (Recommended)
   - System calculates results based on campaign activity
   - Points, momentum, and demographics determine outcomes
   - Most realistic and fair approach

2. **Manual Vote Setting**
   ```
   /election vote admin_bulk_set_votes seat_id:"SEN-CA-1" 
   vote_data:"John Smith:25000,Jane Doe:18000,Bob Wilson:12000"
   ```

3. **Hybrid Approach**
   - Let system calculate most results
   - Manually adjust close races for drama
   - Set realistic vote totals for immersion

**Results and Announcements**

The system automatically:
- Announces phase changes
- Declares winners
- Updates seat holders
- Advances term dates for next cycle

Admins can enhance this with:
- Custom victory speeches
- Transition ceremonies
- Next cycle planning announcements

## 3. Campaign Strategies

### Understanding Campaign Actions

Each campaign action serves a specific purpose and has different effectiveness:

**1. Speeches** (`/speech`)
- **Purpose**: Build general support and name recognition
- **Effectiveness**: Moderate, broad appeal
- **Stamina Cost**: Low-Medium
- **Cooldown**: 4-6 hours
- **Best Used**: Early campaign, building base support
- **Tips**: Write engaging content, longer speeches = more points

**2. Canvassing** (`/canvassing`)
- **Purpose**: Target specific regions with ground game
- **Effectiveness**: High in targeted regions
- **Stamina Cost**: Medium
- **Cooldown**: 6-8 hours
- **Best Used**: Swing states, competitive districts
- **Tips**: Focus on states where you're competitive

**3. Advertisements** (`/ad`)
- **Purpose**: Wide reach across multiple regions
- **Effectiveness**: High but expensive
- **Stamina Cost**: High
- **Cooldown**: 10-12 hours
- **Best Used**: Late campaign, major media markets
- **Tips**: Save for crucial moments, requires video upload

**4. Posters** (`/poster`)
- **Purpose**: Cheap way to build name recognition
- **Effectiveness**: Low but cost-efficient
- **Stamina Cost**: Low
- **Cooldown**: 2-4 hours
- **Best Used**: Continuous presence, early campaign
- **Tips**: Requires image upload, maintain steady presence

**5. Donor Appeals** (`/donor`)
- **Purpose**: Fundraising for future campaigns
- **Effectiveness**: Varies by region and timing
- **Stamina Cost**: Medium
- **Cooldown**: 8-10 hours
- **Best Used**: Building war chest, crisis response
- **Tips**: Target wealthy districts, compelling narratives

### Advanced Action Strategies

**Timing Your Actions**

1. **Early Campaign** (First 1/3 of phase)
   - Focus on posters and speeches
   - Build name recognition
   - Establish presence in key states
   - Conservative stamina use

2. **Mid Campaign** (Middle 1/3 of phase)
   - Increase canvassing frequency
   - Target specific demographics
   - Build momentum in winnable states
   - Moderate stamina expenditure

3. **Late Campaign** (Final 1/3 of phase)
   - Heavy use of ads
   - Focus on swing states
   - Maximum demographic targeting
   - Spend all remaining stamina

**Regional Targeting Strategy**

**Tier 1: Must-Win States**
- Your party's traditional strongholds
- States where you lead in early polling
- Focus 40% of your campaign resources here
- Never neglect these states

**Tier 2: Competitive States**
- True swing states
- States where you trail by <10 points
- Focus 50% of your campaign resources here
- Where elections are won and lost

**Tier 3: Stretch Goals**
- States where you trail by 10-20 points
- Opposition strongholds with potential
- Focus 10% of your campaign resources here
- Only target if you're ahead elsewhere

**Action Effectiveness by Region Type**

Different actions work better in different types of areas:

- **Urban Areas**: Ads and demographic appeals work best
- **Suburban Areas**: Canvassing and town halls effective
- **Rural Areas**: Speeches and poster campaigns resonate
- **Swing Areas**: All actions effective, focus on momentum

### Resource Management

**Stamina System**

Every action costs stamina, which regenerates over time:

- **Total Stamina**: Usually 200 points maximum
- **Regeneration**: Varies by server settings
- **Critical Threshold**: Below 50 stamina = reduced effectiveness
- **Emergency Reserve**: Always keep 20-30 stamina for responses

**Stamina Optimization Strategies**

1. **Front-Loading Strategy**
   - Spend heavily early to build momentum
   - Risk: May run out of stamina for final push
   - Best for: Underdogs who need early attention

2. **Back-Loading Strategy**
   - Conserve stamina for final weeks
   - Risk: May fall too far behind early
   - Best for: Frontrunners with name recognition

3. **Steady Pace Strategy**
   - Consistent stamina usage throughout campaign
   - Risk: May miss crucial moments
   - Best for: Competitive races with multiple viable candidates

**Cooldown Management**

Each action has cooldowns to prevent spam:

- **Track Your Cooldowns**: Use `/demographic_status` to see availability
- **Plan Ahead**: Schedule actions during peak server activity
- **Coordinate**: If running with a VP, coordinate to avoid overlap
- **Emergency Actions**: Save one action type for crisis response

### Coalition Building and Alliances

**Formal Alliances**

- **Running Mates**: Presidential tickets share resources and momentum
- **Party Unity**: Support other candidates from your party
- **Cross-Party Deals**: Sometimes useful in complex multi-party scenarios

**Informal Coordination**

- **Resource Sharing**: Help allies when you're not campaigning
- **Strategic Timing**: Coordinate major announcements
- **Opposition Research**: Share intelligence about opponents
- **Crisis Management**: Support allies during scandals or attacks

## 4. Demographics & Targeting

### Understanding the Demographic System

The demographic system is one of the most powerful tools in the election bot. There are 20+ distinct demographic groups, each with different regional strengths and conflicts with opposing groups.

**Complete Demographic List**

1. **Geographic Demographics**
   - Urban Voters (25 point threshold)
   - Suburban Voters (20 point threshold)
   - Rural Voters (18 point threshold)

2. **Religious Demographics**
   - Evangelical Christians (18 point threshold)

3. **Racial/Ethnic Demographics**
   - African American Voters (22 point threshold)
   - Latino/Hispanic Voters (22 point threshold)
   - Asian American Voters (18 point threshold)
   - Native American Voters (12 point threshold)

4. **Economic Demographics**
   - Blue-Collar / Working-Class Voters (20 point threshold)
   - College-Educated Professionals (20 point threshold)
   - Wealthy / High-Income Voters (15 point threshold)
   - Low-Income Voters (22 point threshold)
   - Tech & Innovation Workers (18 point threshold)

5. **Age Demographics**
   - Young Voters (18–29) (20 point threshold)
   - Senior Citizens (65+) (18 point threshold)

6. **Special Interest Demographics**
   - Military & Veteran Voters (15 point threshold)
   - LGBTQ+ Voters (15 point threshold)
   - Immigrant Communities (15 point threshold)
   - Environmental & Green Voters (18 point threshold)
   - Gun Rights Advocates (18 point threshold)

### State Demographic Strengths

Every state has different demographic compositions that affect your campaign effectiveness:

**Multiplier System**
- **Strong (1.75x)**: Demographics very influential in that state
- **Moderate (0.75x)**: Average influence
- **Small (0.3x)**: Limited influence

**Example: Campaigning for Rural Voters**
- **Strong States**: Alabama, Montana, Wyoming (1.75x multiplier)
- **Moderate States**: Colorado, Pennsylvania (0.75x multiplier)
- **Small States**: California, New York (0.3x multiplier)

**Strategic Implications**
A 1.0 point demographic appeal becomes:
- Alabama: 1.75 points (very effective)
- Colorado: 0.75 points (moderately effective)
- California: 0.3 points (barely effective)

### Demographic Conflict System

**Understanding Backlash**

The system includes a sophisticated backlash mechanism to prevent unrealistic coalition building:

**Backlash Thresholds**
- **90% of threshold**: Soft backlash (-0.5 points to opposing groups)
- **125% of threshold**: Medium backlash (-1.0 points to opposing groups)
- **150% of threshold**: Hard backlash (-2.0 points to opposing groups)

**Major Conflict Pairs**
- Urban Voters ↔ Rural Voters
- Young Voters ↔ Senior Citizens
- Gun Rights Advocates ↔ Environmental Voters
- Evangelical Christians ↔ LGBTQ+ Voters
- Blue-Collar Workers ↔ College-Educated Professionals
- Wealthy Voters ↔ Low-Income Voters

**Complex Conflict Networks**

Some demographics have multiple conflicts:
- Gun Rights Advocates oppose: Environmental Voters, Urban Voters, College-Educated Professionals, most minority groups
- Tech Workers oppose: Blue-Collar Workers, Senior Citizens, Gun Rights Advocates

### Demographic Campaign Strategies

**1. Core Coalition Strategy**

Pick 3-4 compatible demographics and focus heavily on them:

**Example Liberal Coalition**
- Urban Voters (avoid rural areas)
- College-Educated Professionals (target educated suburbs)
- Young Voters (avoid senior-heavy areas)
- Environmental Voters (target green-conscious states)

**Execution**
- Campaign in states where these demographics are strong
- Avoid backlash by staying away from conflicting demographics
- Build to 100% of threshold, then maintain

**2. Broad Appeal Strategy**

Try to appeal to many demographics without triggering major backlash:

**Example Centrist Approach**
- Target demographics to 80-90% of threshold
- Focus on demographics with fewer conflicts
- Use geographic targeting to avoid backlash
- Example: Suburban Voters + Military Veterans + Senior Citizens

**3. Niche Domination Strategy**

Completely dominate 1-2 specific demographics:

**Example Rural Strategy**
- Push Rural Voters to 150%+ (accept urban backlash)
- Add Gun Rights Advocates (compatible)
- Add Evangelical Christians (compatible)
- Focus entirely on rural states
- Ignore urban areas completely

**4. Counter-Programming Strategy**

Deliberately target your opponent's coalition:

**Disruption Tactics**
- If opponent is strong with Young Voters, target Senior Citizens
- If opponent has Urban Voters, focus on Rural Voters
- Use backlash system to weaken opponent's base
- Particularly effective in primaries

### Demographic Action Types

**1. Demographic Speeches** (`/demographic_speech`)
- **Points Gained**: 0.5-1.5 based on speech length and quality
- **Stamina Cost**: 2.0
- **Cooldown**: 8 hours
- **Requirements**: 400-2000 character speech text
- **Best For**: Major policy announcements, rallies

**2. Demographic Posters** (`/demographic_poster`)
- **Points Gained**: 0.3-0.8 (random)
- **Stamina Cost**: 1.5
- **Cooldown**: 6 hours
- **Requirements**: Image upload
- **Best For**: Consistent presence, visual messaging

**3. Demographic Ads** (`/demographic_ad`)
- **Points Gained**: 0.8-1.5 (random)
- **Stamina Cost**: 2.5
- **Cooldown**: 10 hours
- **Requirements**: Video upload (25MB max)
- **Best For**: High-impact moments, major media markets

### Advanced Demographic Tactics

**Geographic Targeting**

Use state strengths to maximize efficiency:

**Research Phase**
1. Use `/view_state_demographics` to see all state multipliers
2. Identify states where your target demographics are strong
3. Plan campaign routes focusing on favorable states

**Execution Phase**
1. Campaign for Rural Voters in Montana, Wyoming, Alabama
2. Campaign for Urban Voters in California, New York, Illinois
3. Use Suburban Voters in purple states like Pennsylvania, Michigan

**Timing Strategies**

**Early Campaign**
- Build foundation with your strongest demographics
- Establish presence before opponents
- Focus on demographics with higher thresholds (more points needed)

**Mid Campaign**
- Expand to secondary demographics
- Begin targeting swing demographics
- Monitor opponent progress and adjust

**Late Campaign**
- Push key demographics over threshold
- Counter-program against opponent's strategy
- Focus on states where you're competitive

**Coalition Maintenance**

Once you reach thresholds:
- Monitor for backlash triggers
- Maintain just above threshold (don't waste points)
- Redirect resources to new demographics
- Defend against opponent counter-programming

**Crisis Management**

When facing backlash:
- Identify which action triggered it
- Calculate if the trade-off was worth it
- Consider temporary pivot to different demographics
- Use geographic targeting to minimize damage

## 5. Momentum System

### Understanding Political Momentum

The momentum system simulates how political parties gain and lose influence in states based on campaign activity, scandals, and voter sentiment. It's a dynamic system that can dramatically alter election outcomes.

**Core Momentum Mechanics**

**Momentum Accumulation**
- Successful campaign actions build momentum
- Momentum multiplies the effectiveness of future actions
- High momentum makes everything easier
- Momentum decays over time without activity

**Momentum Vulnerability**
- Parties with high momentum (50+ points) become vulnerable
- Opponents can trigger "momentum collapse"
- Collapses cause massive momentum loss (30-70%)
- Vulnerable parties have warning indicators (⚠️)

**State-Specific System**
- Each state tracks momentum separately for each party
- State political lean affects momentum gain rates
- Different states have different volatility levels
- Momentum affects polling and final vote calculations

### State Political Leans

Every state has a baseline political lean that affects momentum:

**Lean Intensities and Effects**
- **Strong Lean** (1.5x momentum gain): Deep red/blue states
- **Moderate Lean** (1.2x momentum gain): Typical partisan states  
- **Weak Lean** (1.0x momentum gain): Light red/blue states
- **Swing State** (0.8x momentum gain): True purple states

**Examples by Category**
- **Strong Republican**: Alabama, Wyoming, Idaho
- **Moderate Republican**: Texas, Georgia, Ohio
- **Weak Republican**: Florida, North Carolina
- **Swing States**: Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin
- **Weak Democratic**: Virginia, Colorado, Nevada
- **Moderate Democratic**: Illinois, Oregon, Connecticut
- **Strong Democratic**: California, Massachusetts, Hawaii

### Building Momentum

**Primary Momentum Sources**

1. **Successful Campaign Actions**
   - Speeches, ads, canvassing all build momentum
   - More effective actions = more momentum gained
   - Consistent activity in a state compounds momentum

2. **Demographic Targeting Success**
   - Reaching demographic thresholds boosts momentum
   - Effective demographic campaigns create lasting momentum
   - Geographic targeting multiplies momentum gains

3. **Coalition Building**
   - Endorsements from local figures
   - Cross-party cooperation in some scenarios
   - Grassroots organization building

**Momentum Building Strategies**

**1. Fortress Strategy**
- Pick 2-3 states to completely dominate
- Campaign relentlessly in these states
- Build massive momentum reserves
- Use as launching pad for expansion

**2. Expansion Strategy**
- Start with natural strongholds
- Gradually expand to competitive states
- Maintain presence everywhere
- More risky but higher potential reward

**3. Surgical Strategy**
- Focus on specific types of states
- Example: Target only suburban swing states
- Deep expertise in chosen battlegrounds
- Efficient resource allocation

### Momentum Collapse System

**Vulnerability Triggers**
- Momentum above 50.0 points creates vulnerability
- Vulnerability marked with ⚠️ in status displays
- Multiple party members can trigger collapses
- 6-hour cooldown between collapse attempts

**Collapse Mechanics**
- Reduces momentum by 30-70% of current total
- Affected party loses momentum immediately
- May trigger state lean shifts in extreme cases
- Creates opportunities for opponents

**Defensive Strategies**

**Momentum Management**
- Monitor momentum levels carefully
- Consider deliberately reducing momentum before vulnerability
- Build momentum in multiple states to spread risk
- Coordinate with party members for defense

**Counter-Collapse Tactics**
- Keep some party members ready to trigger collapses
- Monitor opponent momentum for opportunities
- Time collapse attempts for maximum impact
- Coordinate multiple collapse attempts if possible

**Recovery Strategies**
- Diversify momentum across multiple states
- Have backup campaign plans ready
- Use collapses as opportunity to pivot strategy
- Rally party supporters after opponent attacks

### Advanced Momentum Tactics

**Momentum Warfare**

**Offensive Operations**
1. **Vulnerability Creation**
   - Force opponents to build high momentum
   - Create single-state dependencies
   - Time attacks for maximum disruption

2. **Collapse Timing**
   - Strike during crucial campaign phases
   - Coordinate with major news cycles
   - Target states where opponent needs momentum most

3. **Chain Reactions**
   - One collapse can create vulnerability elsewhere
   - Target interconnected state strategies
   - Force opponent into defensive positions

**Defensive Operations**

1. **Redundancy Building**
   - Never depend on single state for momentum
   - Build overlapping momentum networks
   - Create multiple paths to victory

2. **Early Warning Systems**
   - Monitor opponent party member activity
   - Track momentum levels across all states
   - Prepare rapid response capabilities

3. **Damage Control**
   - Have crisis communication plans ready
   - Practice rapid momentum rebuilding
   - Maintain reserve campaign resources

**Momentum and Polling Integration**

**Polling Effects**
- Every 10 points of momentum = ~1% polling shift
- Momentum effects capped at ±15% to prevent extremes
- Momentum affects voter turnout models
- High momentum creates earned media effects

**Strategic Implications**
- Momentum matters more than raw campaign points
- Late momentum swings can overcome early deficits
- Momentum collapse can doom otherwise successful campaigns
- Timing of momentum building is crucial

**Multi-State Strategies**

**Regional Momentum**
- Build momentum in geographic clusters
- Examples: Rust Belt, Southwest, Southeast
- Regional momentum creates media narratives
- Easier to defend contiguous areas

**Coalition Momentum**
- Build momentum among specific demographic groups
- Example: Strong momentum in suburban areas nationwide
- Transcends individual state boundaries
- Creates national narrative opportunities

## 6. Presidential Campaigns

### Presidential Primary System

Presidential campaigns are the most complex and prestigious elections in the bot, featuring unique mechanics and strategic considerations.

**Primary Calendar and Delegate System**

**Early Primary States (High Influence)**
- Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Nevada traditionally go first
- Early victories create momentum and media attention
- Delegate allocation often winner-take-all or proportional
- Strong performance here can make or break campaigns

**Super Tuesday (Mass Delegate Day)**
- Multiple large states vote simultaneously
- California, Texas, New York often included
- Requires significant resource allocation
- Can determine primary winners

**Late Primary States (Cleanup)**
- Smaller states voting after nominees likely decided
- Often ignored unless race is very close
- Good for momentum building and delegate counting
- Final opportunities for upsets

**Delegate Allocation Rules**
- Different states use different allocation methods
- Winner-take-all: Winner gets all delegates
- Proportional: Delegates split by vote percentage
- Hybrid: Combination systems
- Threshold requirements (usually 15% minimum)

**Primary Campaign Strategy**

**1. Early State Strategy**
- Focus heavily on Iowa and New Hampshire
- Personal campaigning and retail politics
- Build name recognition and "electability" narrative
- Risk: Neglecting later states

**2. National Strategy**
- Campaign everywhere from the start
- Use advertising and demographic targeting
- Build broad coalition early
- Risk: Spreading resources too thin

**3. Regional Strategy**
- Focus on specific geographic regions
- Example: Southern strategy, Western strategy
- Deep cultural understanding of target regions
- Risk: Being seen as regional candidate

### Presidential Action System

Presidential candidates have access to enhanced campaign actions with greater effects but higher costs:

**1. Presidential Speeches** (`/pres_speech`)
- **Effect**: 1.5-3.0 points (enhanced)
- **Stamina Cost**: 3.0
- **Cooldown**: 6 hours
- **Special Features**: Can target multiple states, national media coverage
- **Best Used**: Major policy announcements, crisis response

- **Best Used**: Building war chest, crisis response

### Vice Presidential Selection

**VP Selection Strategy**

**Geographic Balance**
- Choose VP from different region than presidential candidate
- Examples: Eastern president + Western VP, Southern president + Northern VP
- Helps with electoral map strategy
- Provides local knowledge and connections

**Demographic Balance**
- Balance age, gender, race, religion, background
- Appeal to different voter coalitions
- Example: Young candidate + experienced VP
- Cover presidential candidate's weaknesses

## 8. Advanced Strategies

### Coalition Building Mastery

**Multi-Demographic Coalition Architecture**

Building successful coalitions requires understanding how demographics interact and reinforcing each other:

**The 3-4-2 Rule**
- 3 Core Demographics: Your absolute base (aim for 110-120% of threshold)
- 4 Supporting Demographics: Secondary targets (aim for 80-100% of threshold)  
- 2 Opportunity Demographics: Stretch goals if resources allow (50-80% of threshold)

**Example Progressive Coalition**
- Core: Urban Voters, College-Educated Professionals, Young Voters
- Supporting: Environmental Voters, Tech Workers, LGBTQ+ Voters, Immigrant Communities
- Opportunity: Asian American Voters, Low-Income Voters

**Geographic Optimization Matrix**

Create a matrix showing where your core demographics are strongest:

```
State         | Urban | College | Young | Environmental
California    | 1.75x | 1.75x   | 1.75x | 1.75x
New York      | 1.75x | 1.75x   | 1.75x | 0.75x
Colorado      | 0.75x | 0.75x   | 0.75x | 0.75x
Texas         | 1.75x | 0.75x   | 0.75x | 0.75x
```

**Strategic Targeting Priority**
1. States where all core demographics are strong (California in example)
2. States where 2-3 core demographics are strong
3. Swing states where at least 1 core demographic is strong
4. Opponent strongholds only if you have overwhelming advantages

### Advanced Momentum Warfare

**Momentum Cascade Strategy**

Create chain reactions that build momentum across multiple states:

**Phase 1: Foundation Building**
- Build moderate momentum (30-40 points) in 5-6 states
- Focus on states with favorable demographic multipliers
- Avoid triggering vulnerability in any single state

**Phase 2: Cascade Initiation**
- Push one strategic state to vulnerability (50+ momentum)
- Use success to build credibility narrative
- Leverage media attention to boost other states

**Phase 3: Cascade Management**
- Before collapse can occur, spread momentum to other states
- Use successful states as launching pads for expansion
- Maintain defensive capabilities in foundational states

**Counter-Momentum Operations**

**Collapse Timing Matrix**
Track opponent momentum and plan strategic collapses:

```
Week 1-2: Identify opponent momentum patterns
Week 3-4: Position party members for collapse attempts
Week 5-6: Execute collapses during crucial campaign moments
Week 7-8: Follow up with own momentum building in affected states
```

**Multi-Vector Attacks**
- Coordinate momentum collapses with demographic counter-programming
- Time attacks with negative campaign ads
- Use third-party allies to trigger additional collapses
- Force opponents into defensive positions across multiple fronts

### Resource Optimization Strategies

**Stamina Management Across Multiple Candidates**

## 9. Admin Tools

### Essential Election Administration

**Initial Server Setup and Configuration**

**Election System Architecture**

Before any campaigns begin, administrators must configure the fundamental election infrastructure:

**Seat Configuration** (`/election admin set_seats`)
This is the foundation of your election system. Consider these factors:

**Realistic Representation**
- Base seats on actual population or server member counts
- Balance small vs. large state representation
- Consider multi-member districts for proportionality
- Plan for growth in server membership

**Election Timing Balance**
- Senate: 6-year terms, staggered elections (1/3 up each cycle)
- House: 2-year terms, all seats up each cycle
- Governor: 4-year terms, coordinate with presidential elections
- President/VP: 4-year terms, every 4 years

**Example Seat Configuration**:
```
Large States (California, Texas, New York):
- 6 Senate seats (2 up each cycle)
- 8-12 House districts
- 1 Governor seat

Medium States (Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan):
- 3 Senate seats (1 up each cycle)
- 4-6 House districts  
- 1 Governor seat

Small States (Wyoming, Vermont, Delaware):
- 3 Senate seats (1 up each cycle)
- 1-2 House districts
- 1 Governor seat
```

**Time Scale Management**

**Realistic Pacing Guidelines**
- Signup Phase: 3-7 real days (allows for coordination)
- Primary Campaign: 7-14 real days (substantial campaigning time)
- Primary Election: 1-3 real days (voting period)
- General Campaign: 14-21 real days (main campaign period)
- General Election: 1-3 real days (final voting)
- Transition: 1-3 real days (setup for next cycle)

**Time Scale Formulas**
- Active Server (high engagement): 30-60 minutes per RP day
- Moderate Server: 60-120 minutes per RP day  
- Casual Server: 120-240 minutes per RP day

**Advanced Election Management**

**Multi-Cycle Planning**

**Presidential Election Years** (Every 4 years)
- All House seats up for election
- 1/3 of Senate seats up for election
- All Governor seats up for election (coordinate with presidential)
- President and Vice President elections
- Highest activity and engagement period

**Midterm Election Years** (2 years after presidential)
- All House seats up for election
- 1/3 of Senate seats up for election (different class than presidential year)
- Some Governor seats up for election
- No presidential election
- Typically lower turnout and engagement

**Off-Year Elections** (Other years)
- Limited special elections only
- Governor elections in some states
- Local or special position elections
- Good time for party building and preparation

**Voting System Management**

**Automated vs. Manual Voting**

**Hybrid Approach** (Recommended)
- Use automated calculations for most races

**Vote Calculation Factors**
The bot considers these factors for automated results:
- Campaign points accumulated
- Momentum levels in relevant states  
- Demographic coalition strength
- State political leans and multipliers
- Random variance for realism

**Manual Vote Setting** (`/election vote admin_bulk_set_votes`)
Use when you need specific outcomes:
```
Example: Close Senate race
/election vote admin_bulk_set_votes seat_id:"SEN-PA-1" 
vote_data:"Smith (D):2,487,156,Jones (R):2,445,791,Wilson (I):184,523"

## 10. Troubleshooting

### Common User Issues and Solutions

**Command Execution Problems**

**"Command on cooldown" Errors**
- **Cause**: User attempting action before cooldown expires
- **Solution**: Wait for cooldown to complete or check remaining time
- **Prevention**: Use `/demographic_status` to track all cooldowns
- **Admin Override**: Use `/admin reset_campaign_cooldowns` if necessary

**Example Resolution Process**:
1. Check remaining cooldown time: `/demographic_status`
2. Plan next action timing based on cooldown info
3. Use different action types if one is on cooldown
4. Contact admin if cooldown seems incorrect

**"Not in correct phase" Errors**
- **Cause**: Attempting phase-specific actions at wrong time
- **Solution**: Check current phase with `/time current_time`
- **Understanding**: Different actions available in different phases
- **Strategy**: Plan campaign timeline around phase restrictions

**Phase-Action Compatibility Guide**:
```
Signup Phase: /signup, /pres_signup, /vp_signup
Primary Campaign: All campaign actions, demographic appeals
Primary Election: Voting only, limited campaign actions
General Campaign: Enhanced campaign actions, momentum system
General Election: Voting only, final appeals
Governance: Administrative actions, next cycle preparation
```

**Permission and Access Issues**

**"Insufficient permissions" Errors**
- **Cause**: Non-admin attempting admin-only commands
- **Solution**: Contact server administrator for assistance
- **Alternative**: Use equivalent non-admin commands where available
- **Understanding**: Some features restricted for game balance

**Admin vs. User Command Reference**:
```
User Commands:
- /speech, /ad, /poster, /canvassing
- /demographic_appeal (presidential candidates)
- /momentum status, /momentum trigger_collapse
- /signup, /withdraw_signup

Admin Commands:
- /election admin set_seats
- /time set_current_time, /time set_time_scale
- /momentum admin add_momentum
- /party admin create, /party admin edit
```

**Registration and Signup Problems**

**"Already signed up" Errors**
- **Cause**: Attempting multiple signups for same office/year
- **Solution**: Use `/withdraw_signup` first, then re-register
- **Note**: Can run for multiple different offices simultaneously
- **Strategy**: Plan your candidate portfolio carefully

**"Invalid region/state" Errors**
- **Cause**: Using incorrect state abbreviations or names
- **Solution**: Check available regions with `/show_regions`
- **Format**: Use exact spelling and capitalization
- **Examples**: "PENNSYLVANIA" not "Pennsylvania", "CALIFORNIA" not "CA"

### Campaign Strategy Troubleshooting

**Low Campaign Effectiveness Issues**

**Actions Not Building Points Effectively**
- **Diagnosis**: Check state demographic multipliers
- **Solution**: Campaign in states where your demographics are strong
- **Tool**: Use `/view_state_demographics` to research
- **Strategy**: Focus on 1.75x multiplier states, avoid 0.3x states

**Example Effectiveness Analysis**:
```
Target: Rural Voters
Strong States (1.75x): Alabama, Montana, Wyoming
Moderate States (0.75x): Colorado, Pennsylvania  
Weak States (0.3x): California, New York

Action Plan: Campaign for Rural Voters in Alabama/Montana/Wyoming
```

**Demographic Backlash Problems**
- **Cause**: Over-appealing to conflicting demographic groups
- **Symptoms**: Losing points in demographics you've previously built
- **Solution**: Check demographic conflicts before targeting
- **Prevention**: Plan coalition strategy to avoid major conflicts

**Backlash Prevention Strategy**:
1. Map out your core demographic coalition
2. Identify all conflicting demographics for each core group
3. Plan geographic targeting to minimize overlap
4. Monitor threshold percentages to avoid trigger points

**Momentum Building Difficulties**
- **Cause**: Inconsistent campaigning or poor state selection
- **Solution**: Increase campaign frequency in target states
- **Strategy**: Build momentum systematically in 2-3 states first
- **Tool**: Use `/momentum status` to track progress

**Momentum Building Best Practices**:
```
Week 1-2: Choose 2-3 target states, begin consistent campaigning
Week 3-4: Build to 30-40 momentum in each target state
Week 5-6: Expand to 2-3 additional states
Week 7-8: Maintain momentum, avoid vulnerability thresholds
```

### Advanced Problem Resolution

**Coalition Management Issues**

**Party Coordination Problems**
- **Symptoms**: Party members working against each other
- **Solution**: Establish party coordination protocols
- **Tools**: Private Discord channels, shared strategy documents

**Alliance and Endorsement Conflicts**
- **Cause**: Competing endorsements or conflicting alliances
- **Resolution**: Negotiate resolution through roleplay
- **Admin Role**: Mediate disputes if necessary
- **Prevention**: Clear alliance terms and expectations

**Resource and Stamina Management Issues**

**Stamina Depletion Problems**
- **Cause**: Poor resource allocation and planning
- **Solution**: Develop stamina budgets and conservation strategies
- **Recovery**: Wait for natural regeneration or admin assistance
- **Prevention**: Track stamina usage patterns and plan accordingly

**Stamina Management Framework**:
```
Total Stamina: 200 points (example)
Reserve: 40 points (20%) - Never spend below this
Active Campaign: 120 points (60%) - Regular campaign activities
Emergency Response: 40 points (20%) - Crisis situations, opportunities
```

**Cooldown Coordination Issues**
- **Cause**: Multiple party members with overlapping cooldowns
- **Solution**: Stagger action timing and specialize roles
- **Tools**: Shared calendars and coordination spreadsheets
- **Strategy**: Assign action specializations to different members

### System Performance and Technical Issues

**Bot Response and Performance Problems**

**Slow Command Response**
- **Cause**: High server load or database performance issues
- **Solution**: Wait for response, avoid spamming commands
- **Reporting**: Contact admin if persistent issues occur
